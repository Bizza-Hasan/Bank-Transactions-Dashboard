I developed a comprehensive project in Excel creating dashboards and tables to analyse the data. This process involved different stages like data pre-processing, data cleaning and data visulization using powerBI.

## Problem Description
<br>
The banking sector is undergoing a transformation from technological advancement to consumer behaviour. As highlighted in figure 1, Barclays' underperformance compared to peers like HSBC and Lloyds over the past year, a symptom of market positioning and investor confidence lagging behind. When it comes to recovery, competitors outperformed Barclays highlighting that in order to regain competitive advantage in the future, Barclays needs to implement better strategic execution, improve customer engagement and rectify operational inefficiencies as the market grows (Cruise et al., 2023). Therefore, at Barclays, data analytics is a chance to level out fee differences between customer groups, satisfy the demand for digital services, and take advantage of customers' seasonal financial decisions. Data gleaned from analyzing customer balances, transaction intensity, and quarterly trends will help Barclays derive new solutions through personalized and tailored marketing messages, improved digital tools, and new Barclays commercial products (Ali et al., 2021). This report will critically evaluate these opportunities within a sound business intelligence framework and propose ideas for improving Barclays Bank's performance in the areas highlighted. <br>
