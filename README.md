## Problem description

The banking sector is undergoing a transformation from technological advancement to consumer behaviour. Barclays' underperformance compared to peers like HSBC and Lloyds over the past year, a symptom of market positioning and investor confidence lagging behind. When it comes to recovery, competitors outperformed Barclays highlighting that in order to regain competitive advantage in the future, Barclays needs to implement better strategic execution, improve customer engagement and rectify operational inefficiencies as the market grows (Cruise et al., 2023). Therefore, at Barclays, data analytics is a chance to level out fee differences between customer groups, satisfy the demand for digital services, and take advantage of customers' seasonal financial decisions. Data gleaned from analyzing customer balances, transaction intensity, and quarterly trends will help Barclays derive new solutions through personalized and tailored marketing messages, improved digital tools, and new Barclays commercial products (Ali et al., 2021). This report will critically evaluate these opportunities within a sound business intelligence framework and propose ideas for improving Barclays Bank's performance in the areas highlighted. <br>

Given that key banking metrics are included in the provided dashboard, it is especially relevant for Organizational decision-making. Barclays can analyze customer behavior in real time by requesting account balances or transaction amounts from their accounts in a variety of channels, occupations and locations (Gunasekaran et al., 2017). The knowledge behind quarterly trends, transaction type distribution and geographic performance of the company, helps to empower data driven strategies to better engage members, optimize financial products and tailor marketing. Furthermore, the filtering options (such as customer age and device utilization) allow also targeted analysis for particular demography, which is essential to decrease the level of financial engagement among younger customers and to optimize generally customer retention and satisfaction.

# Slicer
 
The critical part of this filtering panel is that it enables targeted data analysis within the dashboard, granting incredibly granular control over parameters such as Account ID, Channel, Customer Age, Device ID, Merchant, etc. For example, if filtering by Customer Age, the organization is then able to filter by younger Customers (18-30) and determine how engaged the younger group of customers are with channels like online banking or ATM usage. Like Merchant and Device ID filters, they also provide detailed transaction and interaction tracking across service points, and devices. This functionality thus enables the organization to sharpen strategies, personalize services and make data driven decisions applicable to different customer segments.

# Conclusion

Barclays Bank is at a crossroads where favourable and sustained integration and use of sound data analytics and business intelligence are inevitable in dealing with category 3 and other banking solutions. The analysis identified three primary issues: increased customer apathy towards finances by young customers, lack of embracing online banking services, and fluctuations in customers' financial operations according to the calendar year. Mitigating such difficulties offers Barclays the best chance to fine-tune its products, improve business processes and consolidate its market standing.

# Ensuring the Seasonal Financial Efficiency
Based on the quarterly trend analysis of Barclays' financial statements, the bank can better coordinate product and service portfolios with customer behaviours. For instance, during peak deposit or accumulation season, a Q4, the bank can use sales promotions to push health savings accounts and investment products. During low-intensive periods like Q2, the bank could introduce small financing, including a short-term funding facility or promotional appeals to the customers.
